## Tech Stack

#### Design and Planning:
* Planning with Trello and Evernote
* Mockup with Balsamiq Mockups 3

#### Built With:
* HTML5
* CSS3
    * Normalize.CSS

#### Hosting:
* Gitpages


## Usability and Performance
Usability and Performance were a major consideration in the design decisions. Semantic HTML tags assist screen readers in deciphering the page content. Images are embedded into the HTML instead of the CSS and have descriptive `alt` tags.

To optimize page load all images were compressed and minimal external libraries were imported. Functionalities was built with CSS instead of Javascript.

Tools used were:
* https://a11yproject.com/checklist
* https://achecker.ca/checker/index.php
* Chrome extension: Lighthouse


## Design process
Design was an iterative process over multiple stages. The first stage was framing the project's purpose, target audience, moods, and overall theme. The second stage was brainstorming content, features, and design. The third and final step was wireframing the designs.

## Short Answer Q&A on the Internet

#### Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today

There are many key developments in the history of the internet from the 1980s to today. Standing on the shoulders of giants has enable human ingenuity to create the amazing world we all enjoy today. A few of the notable milestones include:

In 1982, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) was declared the standard for all military computer networking.

In 1983, the Internet Engineering Task	Force published the original specifications for the Domain Name System (DNS).

In 1989, AOL introduces American Online service which was designed for people unfamiliar with computers unlike previous services.

In 1990, Tim Berners-Lee develops HyperText Markup Language (HTML).

In 1993, Marc Andreessen with colleagues at the University of Illinois create Mosaic, the first Web browser to combine graphics and text on a single page.

In 1998, the Google search engine is born.


#### Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers

The internet consist of a network of networks. Below is a high-level explanation of what happens when someone enters https://catprotection.org.au/ in their browser.

When an user enters the address in the web browser it tries to determine the site’s IP address. It will first search its cache. If it does not have a record of it, the browser will make a request to the user’s ISP whom may then request the IP address from a DNS. The DNS will forward the IP address back to the ISP whom will forward it back to the user.

With the IP address the user will then request resources from the site’s web server. The web server will process the users request, handle any internal requests, and serve back the to user HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The user’s web browser will then render those resources for user to interactive with.


#### Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today

The internet started off as a decentralized network. Hardware came with software without additional costs and the source code was openly shared. From the early 1980s, as software cost increased and large-scaled systems matured, fewer organizations allowed modifications to their sources code and eventually only distributed executable machine code. Companies also began charging software licensing fees. Despite these changes in the industry, there were those who viewed these practices as ethically wrong and continued to share source code.

First released in 1991, the Linux kernel was the first completely free operating system. It has been ported to other platforms including the Android OS, embedded systems, servers, and supercomputers. Android is now the world’s most popular mobile platform. As of 2010 six of the top ten hosting companies ran Linux on their web servers. As of 2017, all of the supercomputers on the 500 list run Linux.
