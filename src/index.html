        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I am a Canadian web development looking for opportunities based in Sydney. Currently I am practicing full stack web development full time at Coder Academy. In my spare time, I frequently hanging out at Meetups at night (JS, Ruby, Blockchain) or soaking in the beautiful scenery during the weekends.</p>

        </div>
        <p>In my previous career, I was a real estate appraiser in the public section for six years in Vancouver, Canada. Crunching data, building valuation models and defending my market estimation was my daily routine. Spreadsheets were my best friend. After moving to Sydney, I contributed to Optus’s mobile deployment property team. Had a great time but I am looking to help people in other ways and at greater scale by leveraging technology,
        I looking forward to working with you. Let’s build something great together.</p>
